# Vehicle Damage Plugin\r
\r
This Plugin saves the vehicle damage on wheels, windows and lights in the athena database.\r
A player can no longer repair the vehicle by parking in and out. He is forced to drive to a workshop or call the towing service.\r
\r
# Installation\r
\r
1. Purchase the repo access\r
\r
https://mygp.gumroad.com/l/vehicledamage\r
\r
2. Copy folder plugins/gpVehicleDamage/ to your athena project under src/core/plugins/\r
3. Import server plugin in src/core/plugins/imports.ts:\r
\r
    \`import './gpVehicleDamage/index';\`\r
    \r
4. One change at the athena core is necessary (currently not found a good way around it):\r
\r
    Add the line 2 and 64 from the snippet below to the file src/cire/server/systems/tick.ts\r
\r
    \`\`\`\r
    1:  import * as alt from 'alt-server';\r
    2:  import { GpDamage } from '../../plugins/gpVehicleDamage/gpVehicleDamage';  //Import Vehicle Damage Plugin\r
    ...\r
    63: VehicleFuncs.update(player.vehicle);\r
    64: GpDamage.saveDamageForVehicle(player.vehicle); //Save Damage\r
\r
    \`\`\`\r
\r
# Deinstallation\r
\r
1. Remove the folder gpVehicleDamage under src/core/plugins/\r
2. Remove line 2 and line 64 from athena core file src/cire/server/systems/tick.ts\r
\r
# Notes\r
\r
1. The athena vehicle database will be extended by a property named "damage", which includes several damage informations.\r
2. Some damage data can be potentially crash the game after a GTA Update. Therefore these data will automatically erased and updated by the plugin. However, this leads to the fact that not all damages can be restored after an update.`,html:`<h1 id="vehicle-damage-plugin">Vehicle Damage Plugin</h1>
